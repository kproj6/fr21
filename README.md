# Functional requirement 2.1
## Get a map up and running

this is a early prototype of the map user interface 

if you have nodeJS installed run 
  npm install
to install dependencies.

then run 
  gulp
to run a server on localhost:8080, and have the browser reload every time you make changes to a html, css or js file.
